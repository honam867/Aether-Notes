# 📋 Survey Process Guide

## What I've Created

I've analyzed your existing PRD documents and created a **comprehensive survey** to understand your exact requirements before implementation.

### 📄 Documents Created:

1. **`SERVER_SURVEY.md`** ✅ - Backend/Server feature survey (80+ questions)
2. **`CLIENT_SURVEY.md`** ⏳ - Frontend/Client survey (coming after you complete server survey)

---

## 🎯 Survey Structure (Backend)

The **SERVER_SURVEY.md** covers 13 major sections:

### Core Features:
1. **Project Overview** - Vision, scale, authors
2. **Posts Management** - Lifecycle, content, status workflow
3. **Comments System** - Threading, moderation, spam protection
4. **Interactions** - Likes, bookmarks, counters
5. **Categories & Tags** - Hierarchy, limits, management

### Technical Aspects:
6. **Authorization & Roles** - User permissions, access control
7. **Analytics & Tracking** - View counts, activity logs
8. **Notifications** - Future notification needs
9. **Performance** - Caching, optimization strategies

### Development:
10. **Testing & Quality** - Test coverage, documentation
11. **Data & Seeding** - Import/export, seed data
12. **Priorities & Timeline** - Feature ranking, MVP definition
13. **Code Preferences** - Architecture decisions

## 📝 How to Use This Survey

### Step 1: Review & Answer
1. Open `SERVER_SURVEY.md`
2. Read each question carefully
3. Mark your answers with `[x]` for checkboxes
4. Fill in text answers where needed
5. Add notes/explanations in the blank spaces

### Step 2: Share Your Answers
Once completed, share the filled survey with me by:
- Saving the file with your answers
- OR copying your answers in our conversation

### Step 3: I'll Generate New PRD
Based on your answers, I will:
1. **Analyze** your requirements
2. **Create** a new detailed PRD tailored to your needs
3. **Prioritize** features based on your preferences
4. **Simplify** or expand features as needed
5. **Generate** implementation plan with tasks

## 💡 Tips for Answering

### Be Honest:
- ✅ "I don't know" is a valid answer
- ✅ "Not sure, recommend something" is fine
- ✅ Explain your reasoning if helpful

### Think About:
- **Scale**: How big will this grow?
- **Complexity**: Do you need all features or keep it simple?
- **Timeline**: What's urgent vs. nice-to-have?
- **Maintenance**: Who will maintain this?

### Example Good Answers:

❌ **Bad**: "Yes" (no context)

✅ **Good**: "Yes, but low priority. I might add this in 3-6 months after MVP."

✅ **Good**: "Not sure. I want comments but worried about spam. What do you recommend?"

✅ **Good**: "No for MVP, but definitely Phase 2. Let's keep the database ready for it."

## 🚦 What Happens Next?

### After You Complete SERVER Survey:

1. **I'll review** your answers
2. **Ask clarifying questions** if needed
3. **Generate CLIENT_SURVEY.md** (Frontend questions)

### After You Complete BOTH Surveys:

1. **Generate new PRD** documents:
   - `BE_PRD_v2.md` - Detailed backend requirements
   - `FE_PRD_v2.md` - Frontend requirements (after client survey)
   - `DATABASE_PRD_v2.md` - Updated database schema
   
2. **Create implementation plan**:
   - Prioritized task list
   - Phased approach (MVP → Phase 2 → Phase 3)
   - Estimated complexity per feature
   
3. **Generate database migrations**:
   - Create schema based on final requirements
   - Seed data scripts
   
4. **Start implementation**:
   - Begin with highest priority features
   - Follow clean architecture principles
   - Maintain the logging/error handling we just set up

## ❓ Questions You Might Have

### Q: "Do I need to answer ALL questions?"
**A**: Ideally yes, but you can skip questions and write "Not sure, decide for me" - I'll make reasonable defaults.

### Q: "Can I change my mind later?"
**A**: Absolutely! This is just to get started. We can adjust as we go.

### Q: "What if I don't understand a question?"
**A**: Ask me! I'll explain it in simpler terms or give examples.

### Q: "How long will this take?"
**A**: 15-30 minutes to thoughtfully answer the survey. Worth it to avoid building the wrong thing!

### Q: "Can we start coding now?"
**A**: We *could*, but you might end up with features you don't need or missing features you want. The survey ensures we build exactly what you need.
